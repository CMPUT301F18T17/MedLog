# MedLog
# Our project helps patients to record their problems on their bodies.
# Patients can record what happened with their bodies.
# There will be a paper-doll-cut-out-like image in our application, 
# and patients can click different parts of the image to record which parts of their bodies feel bad,
# and they can record the environment around them when they feel bad,
# and they can record the location with the GPS.
# They can also upload pictures of their symptoms, 
# and they can make a comment, or questions with the pictures they want to ask the doctor.
# Our application will also recommand patients to record their symptoms in a certain period,
# and patients can setting the period they want.
