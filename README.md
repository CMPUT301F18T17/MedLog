# MedLog
CMPUT301 F18 T17 project

MedLog is our groups project to design an application that helps people to document their health issues for doctors to later
examine.

With this application: 

Patients can create different recorded health problems that they see.

They can add records detailing the current status of those problems.

These recorded issues can then be viewed by Care Providers who are assigned to these patients.

These Care Providers in turn can leave further comment records in response to these problems.
